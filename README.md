Fully Portable Roop: One-Click Deepfake Software

# Description
This project is a portable adaptation of [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop), a software that enables you to create a deepfake from a single image. My primary goal is to simplify the software's installation process. This project offers a fully portable solution for installing and using Roop, ensuring its accessibility and convenience from any location.

The project aligns with the version of [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop) at commit [43a8d9f7f371d083852183ea752ef8cdd944dab3](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/commit/43a8d9f7f371d083852183ea752ef8cdd944dab3). Any significant feature updates or crucial bug fixes in the original repository will prompt an update to this project as well.

The only thing that I've changed from the original repo is the removal of the NSFW filter, as it produced a lot of false positives, even on fully SFW images.

# Installing
1. Clone this repository or download the .zip file.
   - If you downloaded the .zip file, extract it.
2. Move the folder containing the .bat files to your desired location. **Important: The .bat files should reside in an unoccupied folder or a folder you don't mind clearing out, as the installation process will remove all existing files and folders in the same location.**
3. Run "Launch Roop.bat".
4. Enjoy using Roop :)
